# Simone-says-game
The combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript creates an interactive and visually appealing Simon 
Says game, challenging players to remember and reproduce increasingly complex color sequences. 
The highest level achieved by the player is persistently stored using local storage, providing a 
competitive element to encourage replay.
